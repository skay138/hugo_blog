Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some
 duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most
 twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the
 **same**.


Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result
 be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are
 `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of
 `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the
 first `k` elements.


Return `k` *after placing the final result in the first* `k` *slots of* `nums`.


Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the
 input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.


**Custom Judge:**


The judge will test your solution with the following code:



```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
**Output:** 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```

**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
**Output:** 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
* `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

!!!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!!!


Just take 2 variables fast and slow and place at 2nd
 index and check both are equal or not. If it is
 equal increase the fast variable else nums[slow++] =
 nums[fast++].


Hey! are you thinking it's completed,  

 Think what you have to return and what you have to
 do if size is less than 2 ?

Works on my machine. It is the second time I've had
 their TS behave differently than TS loaded locally.
 This is frustrating.

non-decreasing order is just a fancy way to say that
 the array is sorted in ascending order. 😅

I submitted an answer based on a new Array B. I scan
 the Array A and only put the first 1-2 of the same
 numbers to B. Then copy the B back to A.


It requires O(N) space. Is there any way to solve
 this question with O(1) space?

"remove some duplicates in-place such that each
 unique element appears at most twice"


1. If an element appears twice it is not unique
2. "At most twice" is a vague constraint because it
 is satisfied by elements in the output appearing
 zero times, one time, or two times

When I run my Java code in my IDE I get the correct
 result but when I put it in Leetcode and run it, it
 gets an incorrect answer on case 2. It says the code
 outputs [0,0,1,1,1,2,3] instead of [0,0,1,1,2,3,3].
 I'm stumped. Here's my code. What am I doing
 wrong?  

 class Solution {  

 public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {  

 for(int TR=2; TR < nums.length-1; TR=TR+2){  

 if(nums[TR]==nums[TR - 1]){  

 nums[TR] = Integer.MAX\_VALUE;  

 Arrays.sort(nums);  

 nums = Arrays.copyOf(nums, nums.length-1);  

 TR=TR-2;  

 }  

 }  

 Arrays.sort(nums);  

 return nums.length;  

 }  

 }

The main idea is to use binary search to find the
 rightmost value that equal to current value.


And, for the upper bound of search range, we don't
 need to set it as the end of the array, instead, we
 can double the length of range each time, until it's
 unequal to current value.
